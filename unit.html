   <p>Lesson 1: Welcome to CSP" introduces students to Computer Science Principles through a hands-on approach. The lesson begins with a warm welcome and an overview of the course. Students are tasked with forming groups to create a "rapid" prototype of an innovative idea, fostering collaboration and creativity from the outset. Additionally, students engage with a short video highlighting significant computing innovations, providing context and inspiration for their own project work. This lesson sets the stage for exploration, teamwork, and discovery throughout the course.</p>
  <h4>C.F.U</h4>
  <!--This is the CFU answer-->
      <p>Reflect and Summarize:
      What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?

      Please write a short paragraph. Don't worry about spelling, grammar, or how well written it is.
        <br>
       <br> "I learn best by pattern recognition, I see a pattern and then repeat it with similar questions. Its most like the last student since they use like practice problems. Most of the other ones don't follow my mindset though, I have bad sleep but I can still catch up."

<b>Lesson 2</b>
    <p>Lesson 2: Representing Information" guides students in designing a device capable of transmitting information across a room using readily available household items. The lesson encourages creativity and problem-solving as students explore different ways to represent and transmit data effectively. Resources provided include digital and interactive notebook versions of the Unit 1 Journal, facilitating documentation and reflection on the learning process. Through this hands-on activity, students delve into the fundamental concepts of information representation, setting the stage for deeper exploration in subsequent lessons.</p>
    <h4>C.F.U</h4>
        <p>Reflection: Sending Complex Messages
          Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?

          For example:

          Modifications with two options

          bend straw forward once,
          bend straw backwards once,
          bend straw forwards twice,
          bend straw backwards twice,
          vs.

          Four options

          bend straw forward,
          bend straw backwards,
          bend straw to the left,
          bend straw to the right,
          <br>
<br>"Its easier and less complicated, the four options can also result in many different patterns.  Its easier for the viewer to understand"
    </p>
  </div>
    <div class="wave1" id="L3">
<b>Lesson 3</b>
       <p>Lesson 3: Circle Square Patterns" involves the development of a system for generating and organizing patterns composed of circles and squares. Students engage with the activity guide provided, which offers structured support for exploring various pattern formations. Additionally, shape cutouts are available as a resource to aid in hands-on experimentation and visualization. Through this lesson, students not only refine their understanding of geometric shapes and patterns but also cultivate critical thinking skills as they devise strategies for creating and categorizing intricate designs.</p>
          <h4>C.F.U</h4>
              <p>Reflection: Counting in Binary
                How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?

                <br>
                <br>
                I would tell them the definition of a number system, the mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set by using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. then start teaching them numbers and how it works.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="wave1" id="L4">
<b>Lesson 4</b>
        <p>Lesson 4: Binary Numbers" focuses on teaching students how to represent numbers in binary (base 2) format, following on from their exploration of circle-square patterns in the previous lesson. Students will utilize a manipulative called a "Flippy Do" to aid in converting between binary and decimal (base 10) numbers. Through hands-on activities outlined in the provided activity guide, students will practice converting numbers and delve into the concept of place value within the context of binary representation. Key vocabulary introduced includes binary, bit (binary digit), byte (8 bits), and decimal. This lesson equips students with foundational knowledge essential for understanding computer systems and digital information representation.</p>
        <h4>C.F.U</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
            <p>Moving from 4-bits to 8-bits
              Two schools are merging and to adapt to the increased size of the student body, the school is changing its system for keeping track of all student IDs from a system that uses 4-bit binary numbers to one that uses 8-bit binary numbers (AKA 1 byte). Which of the following best describes what effect this change will have?

              <br>
              <br>
               The 8-bit system will be able to represent sixteen times as many values as the 4-bit system.
              <br>
              <br>
              Reflection: Adding Bits
              Each time we add another bit, what happens to the amount of numbers we can make?
              <br>
              <br>
              The amount of numbers we can make doubles.
              <br>
              <br>
              Reflection: Bits Needed
              How many bits would be needed to count all of the students in class today?
              <br>
              <br>
              8 bits.
              <br>
              <br>
              Reflection: Binary vs Decimal
              What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?
              <br>
              <br>
              decimal uses 10, binary uses 2 places, but both could make numbers
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="wave1" id="L5">
  <b>Lesson 5</b>
          <p>Lesson 5: Overflow and Rounding" delves into the constraints of representing numbers using bits, focusing on two key concepts: overflow error and round-off error. Overflow error occurs when attempting to represent a number that exceeds the capacity of the available bits, leading to inaccuracies or system failures. Conversely, round-off error arises when representing a number with excessive precision, necessitating rounding to a manageable level. Through exploration and discussion, students gain insight into the practical limitations of numerical representation in digital systems. This lesson enhances their understanding of the nuances involved in working with binary data, preparing them to address potential errors and optimize computational processes effectively.</p>
          <h4>C.F.U</h4>
              <p>Reflection: Binary Fractions
                When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?

                <br>
                <br>
                You are unable to represent every possible fraction of an integer using bits. The reason for this is that some numbers are either too big or too small to be represented.
          </p>
          </div>
          <div class="wave1" id="L6">
  <b>Lesson 6</b>
            <p>Lesson 6: Representing Text" guides students in developing a system for encoding text using bits, building upon their understanding of representing numbers. By leveraging their knowledge of binary representation gained in previous lessons, students explore methods for translating text characters into binary code. The provided ASCII Reference Sheet serves as a valuable resource, facilitating the mapping of characters to their corresponding binary representations according to the ASCII encoding standard. Through this lesson, students deepen their comprehension of how digital systems manipulate and store textual data, laying the foundation for further exploration into information encoding and communication protocols.</p>
            <h4>C.F.U</h4>
                <p> "In this lesson, students create a system for representing text using only numbers while communicating with each other. They are only allowed to send numbers back-and-forth, so they must create a system to translate between number and character. Most importantly they should understand the challenges or principles that led to the creation of these systems and that these systems are somewhat arbitrarily created to solve a shared problem. They work not because there was "one right answer" but because many people agreed to use them. At the end of the main activity they briefly review the ASCII system for representing text. The wrap up discussion emphasizes how all of the concepts thus far have ‘built’ on each other and introduces the concept of abstraction to describe this progression."
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="wave1" id="L7">
  <b>Lesson 7</b>
              <p>Lesson 7: Black and White Images" introduces students to how computers represent black and white images using bits. They explore the concepts of analog and digital data, with analog data being continuously variable (e.g., music, colors of a painting) and digital data being discrete and finite. Through the process of sampling, students learn how digital representations of analog data are created by measuring the data at regular intervals, called samples. The provided activity guide offers hands-on exercises to deepen understanding, while the "B&W Pixelation Tutorial" video provides additional visual guidance. By engaging with these resources, students develop insights into the conversion of visual information into digital formats, laying the groundwork for further exploration into image processing and digital graphics.</p>
              <h4>C.F.U</h4>
                  <p>Assume your friend just sent you 32 bits of pixel data (just the 0s and 1s for black and white pixels) that were encoded after sampling an image. Choose the two statements that are true.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The fact that only 32 bits were used to represent the image indicates relatively large sample squares were used. The digital image may vary from the analog image significantly.
                    <br>  
                    <br>
                    Reflection: Sampling
                    Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I would use 4 width x 6 height but that will greatly decrease the image accuracy.  I can go for a bigger sample size but that would go against her request. I would need to sacrifice image quality, making a good digital approximation is not easy only have 24 bits
              </p>
              </div>
              <div class="wave1" id="L8">
  <b>Lesson 8</b>
                <p>Lesson 8: Color Images" focuses on understanding how computers represent color images using bits. The lesson likely involves exploring various color models such as RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) and how they are encoded digitally. It may also cover concepts such as color depth, which determines the range of colors that can be represented in an image, and compression techniques to reduce file size while maintaining image quality.</p>
                <h4>C.F.U</h4>
                    <p>Which statement about analog and digital images is true?

                            <br>
                            <br>
                      Sampling an analog image more frequently produces a digital image with a better representation.
                            <br>  
                            <br>
                      Reflection:
                      Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                      Using 3 sets of bits, we can use each section to represent RGB. If we split the bits, we can separate them. 000 red 000 green 000 blue. This is how the computer is able to read colors using binary, we can also use different sections together to make different colors.

  <b>Lesson 9</b>
                  <p>Lesson 9: Lossless Compression" introduces students to the concept of reducing the number of bits needed to represent data without losing any information, a process known as lossless compression. This lesson aims to familiarize students with techniques for optimizing data storage and transmission efficiency while ensuring that the original information can be fully recovered.</p>
                  <h4>C.F.U</h4>
                      <p>What is the most important quality of lossless compression?

                              <br>
                              <br>
                        The data is transformed to usually make it smaller. It can always be re-constructed back to the original.
                              <br>  
                              <br>
                        Reflection:
                        An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider.

                        If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?
                              <br>
                              <br>
                        I would explain that none of her data would actually be lost and the changes will be reversible, the computer will use the patterns in the book and reduce the bytes.
                        </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="wave1" id="L10">
  <b>Lesson 10</b>
                    <p>Lesson 10: Lossy Compression" delves into the concept of reducing the number of bits required to represent data by sacrificing some information or detail, known as lossy compression. Unlike lossless compression, where all data can be fully recovered, lossy compression involves irreversible loss of information.</p>
                    <h4>C.F.U</h4>
                        <p>Reflection:
                          You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?



                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Messages are best for lossless compression as you can replace patterns/long words with short recognizable. Videos and any visual is best with lossy compression because it helps reduce the amount of bytes used inside of the video
                    </p>

  <b>Lesson 11</b>

                      <p>Lesson 11: Intellectual Property" educates students about the concepts surrounding ownership and sharing of digital information. Students explore the notion of intellectual property, understanding it as creative works or inventions that individuals have rights to and may protect through patents, copyrights, trademarks, etc.</p>
                      <h4>C.F.U</h4>
                          <p>How is a Creative Commons license different from a regular copyright?

                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                            It allows your work to be shared, reused, and remixed to help spark more creativity.
                                  <br>  
                                  <br>
                            Reflection:
                            As a reminder, in the warm-up we saw this scenario:

                            Imagine you were using some of our pixelation tools to create an image and you posted it online for your friends to see - but, a week later you find out someone took that image and put it on a T-shirt that they’re selling for $10 each.

                            Now that we understand Copyright, what would need to change in order for the scenario from the warm-up to be okay?
                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                            for the scenario to be okay, the person selling the T-shirts would need to get permission from the original image creator to use their picture. Without that permission, it's a violation of copyright law.

  <b>Lesson 12</b>
                        <p>Lesson 12: Project Digital Information Dilemmas" involves students reading about a contemporary event or societal issue stemming from the digitization of information. They then share their findings and engage in discussions with classmates regarding the broader implications of digitization.</p>
                        <h4>C.F.U</h4>
                            <p>Reflection:
                              Many museums have digital catalogs of their collections. What are the potential benefits and harms of creating these digital catalogs?

                                    <br>
                                    <br>

                              Creating digital catalogs of museum collections allows people to explore artworks and artifacts online, making them accessible to a wider audience and offering valuable educational resources for students and enthusiasts. These digital records also help in preserving cultural heritage and enhancing visitor engagement through interactive features. However, there are challenges such as intellectual property concerns, privacy and security risks, and potential exacerbation of the digital divide. Museums must navigate these complexities while ensuring equitable access and addressing ethical considerations surrounding cultural heritage repatriation.
                                    <br>

                              Digital Information
                              Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally?
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                              We should care about information being represented digitally because it revolutionizes accessibility and communication. Digital representation allows for instant access to vast amounts of knowledge and facilitates seamless sharing and collaboration. Personally, digital information impacts me profoundly as it forms the basis of my existence as an AI language model, enabling me to assist users like you with inquiries and tasks. Moreover, in my daily life, digital information enhances convenience and efficiency, whether it's for communication, learning, or staying informed. However, it's important to remain vigilant about the ethical implications and challenges associated with digital data, such as privacy concerns and misinformation.
