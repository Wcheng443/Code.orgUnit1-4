    <p>The Basics of Computer Science Unit 1: Digital Information is an introduction to the basic ideas of digital information. It covers things like binary representation, data compression, encryption, and how to describe multimedia data. As students learn about how data is stored, sent, and changed in digital systems, they also learn about the basic ideas that guide modern computers. Students learn the basics of building websites with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) in Web Unit 1: Basic HTML. They learn about the parts of web pages that make them work, like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and pictures. Students also learn how to use HTML to organize and show content on the internet and get hands-on practice making simple web pages. This unit is the first step in learning web creation. It gets students ready for more advanced topics in making websites that are dynamic and interactive.

        <p>In Unit 2 of CS Principles, "The Internet," you will learn about the basic ideas behind the internet, including its organization, protocols, and how data is sent between networks. Students learn about the background and growth of the internet, as well as how it works and what servers, clients, routers, and protocols like TCP/IP do. They also look at how the internet has changed society by talking about things like privacy problems, net neutrality, and the digital divide. Students learn more about how the internet works and how important it is in current culture, business, and communication through hands-on projects and activities. This unit gives you a broad look at the technological and social aspects of the internet. It sets the stage for further study in computer science and related areas.

        <p> Basics of CS Introduction to App Design (Unit 3) teaches students everything they need to know about the basics and best practices of making mobile apps. Students learn about the basic ideas of user experience (UX) design, user interface (UI) design, and the iterative design process in this unit. They learn how important it is to know what users want, do study on those needs, and make prototypes of their designs to test and improve them. Students are also taught basic programming ideas and given the tools they need to make mobile apps. Using tools like MIT App Inventor or similar visual programming environments, they learn about event-driven programming, how to handle user input, and how to make simple apps. Students work on real projects throughout the unit to create, build, and test their own mobile apps, focusing on how well they work, how engaging they are for users, and how easy they are to use. By the end of the unit, students have a strong understanding of how to create apps and have learned how to make apps for their phones. This sets them up for further study in computer science and app development.

        <p> CS Principles Unit 4: Variables, Conditionals, and Functions is all about basic computing ideas that you need to know in order to think computationally and solve problems. The basics of variables, conditionals, and functions are covered by students, which sets them up to understand and build algorithms and programs. The first part of the unit is about variables, which are like storage spaces for data in a program. Students learn about the different kinds of data, how to set up variables, and how to give variables numbers. They look into how variables are used to change data and figure out computer problems. Conditions are presented as building blocks that let programs make decisions. Students learn about if statements, else statements, and else-if statements. They learn how these structures let programs run different sets of code based on certain situations. Functions are highlighted as blocks of code that can be used again and again to do specific jobs. Students learn how to make functions, give them arguments, and get numbers back from them. They also understand the idea of scope, which tells you where in a program you can reach variables. Students use what they've learned by doing hands-on coding projects and tasks throughout the unit. They learn how to use variables to store data, conditionals to make choices, and functions to group code together and use it again and again. By the end of the unit, students have a strong understanding of the basics of programming, which sets them up for more advanced computer science and software development topics.
