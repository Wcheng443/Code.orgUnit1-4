       <p>Lesson 1: Variables Explore" introduces students to variables, exploring how information is stored and processed in programs. Key vocabulary includes assignment operator, expression, string, and variable. Resources provided include an activity guide for creating a Photo Liker App, a video on debugging global vs local variables, and digital and interactive notebook journals for documentation.
</p>
      <h4>C.F.U</h4>
          <p>Multiple Choice: What's the value?
            What will the value of score be at the end of the program?
            <br>
           <br>  "B.   The score is: 4"

    <b>Lesson 2</b>
        <p>Lesson 2: Variables Investigate" involves investigating and modifying sample apps that use variables, learning common programming patterns. Students engage with code snippets and explore the concept of variables in depth.
</p>
        <h4>C.F.U</h4>
            <p>Updating Variables
              Explain in your own words the process of creating and updating a variable. How does the Counter Pattern with Event work?
              <br>
    <br>"When an on-event is executed during the counter event pattern, the variable is updated. The variable will alter if reassignment is present in the on-event and an action, such as a click, is made."

                <h4>C.F.U</h4>
                    <p>Using if-else-if
                      When creating an if-else-if statement you should always make your first condition the most specific. Write a short paragraph responding to the questions below.

                      What does it mean to put the most specific case first?
                      Why is it important to put the most specific case first? What types of errors does it help avoid?
<br>
                      <br>
                      "Putting the most specific case first in an if-else-if statement means ordering the conditions based on their specificity or uniqueness, with the most detailed condition placed at the beginning. This is important because it ensures that the program evaluates the conditions in a logical and efficient manner. When the most specific case is checked first, the program can quickly determine whether that condition is true or false, potentially avoiding unnecessary checks for less specific cases. This organization helps prevent errors such as unintended matches or ambiguous outcomes, as the program prioritizes the conditions based on their specificity, making the code more readable, efficient, and less prone to logical mistakes."
