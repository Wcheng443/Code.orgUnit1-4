      <h4>C.F.U</h4>
          <p>Reflection
            How do you use the Internet?

            Think about your typical day. When are you using the Internet? For what purposes? What role does it have in your life?
            <br>
           <br> "I am using the internet to check hw answers and to talk to friends it also allows me to do my homework.  it has a very important orle in my life as it helps me have entertainment in my life and also improves my quality of life"

    </div>
      <div class="wave1" id="L2">
    <b>Lesson 2</b>
        <p>Lesson 2: Building a Network" continues the exploration of networks, covering concepts such as bandwidth, computing devices, computing networks, computing systems, and network paths. This lesson lays the groundwork for understanding network architecture and design principles.</p>
        <h4>C.F.U</h4>
            <p>Describe two different paths that a message could take from Person A to Person D.
              <br>
    <br>"They can go from A to B to D or A to E TO C TO D"

    <b>Lesson 3</b>
           <p>Lesson 3: The Need for Addressing" delves into how computers communicate across networks, introducing terms like IP address, Internet Protocol (IP), and protocols. Resources include the video "The Internet: IP Addresses and DNS" and an activity guide for further exploration of addressing protocols.</p>
              <h4>C.F.U</h4>
                  <p>Pick the two statements that are true about the Internet Protocol (IP):

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Each device or computer on the Internet is assigned a unique IP address and  IP is the shared way that all devices and computers label their messages with the sender and receiver's addresses."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Describe how the Internet Protocol (IP) allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the Internet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "IP information is attached to each packet, and this information helps routers to send packets to the right place"
              </p>
          </div>
          <div class="wave1" id="L4">
    <b>Lesson 4</b>
            <p>Lesson 4: Routers and Redundancy" explores the role of routers in routing information through networks and the importance of redundancy for fault tolerance. Key vocabulary includes fault tolerant, redundancy, and router, emphasizing network reliability and resilience.
</p>
            <h4>C.F.U</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
                <p>Pick Two: If the post office delivered mail exactly like the routers deliver messages on the Internet, which of the following statements would be true?

                  <br>
                  <br>
                   "The mailman would sometimes take a different path to deliver each letter to your home and Letters would be written on the outside of the envelope for all to read instead of letters put inside envelopes"
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  What are the benefits of building redundancy into a network? What are the potential issues with building redundancy?
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  "Building redundancy into a network allows the system to be fault tolerant"

            <div class="wave1" id="L5">
      <b>Lesson 5</b>
              <p>Lesson 5: Packets" covers the concept of data packets and protocols enabling their transmission over the internet. Resources include the video "The Internet: Packets, Routing, and Reliability" and an activity guide for hands-on exploration of packet-based communication, deepening students' understanding of network transmission.

      <b>Lesson 6</b>
                <p>Lesson 6: HTTP and DNS" teaches how websites are shared and examines internet access equality. Vocabulary includes Domain Name System (DNS), HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and World Wide Web. Resources include activity guides and videos on internet layers, HTTP, and DNS.
</p>
                <h4>C.F.U</h4>
                    <p>In your own words explain the following about the Domain Name System

                      What problem does the DNS solve?
                      How does the DNS help the world wide web scale so that billions of users can access billions of web pages?
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      the problem that DNS, or the domain name system, solves is that it is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses. DNS helps the World Wide Web scale since it is used by many different computers that are all connected to the network.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Choose the two statements that best describe the relationship between HTTP and the World Wide Web
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      HTTP and the World Wide Web both rely on other layers of protocols for sending information on the Internet and  The World Wide Web is a collection of pages and files that is shared between computers using HTTP
