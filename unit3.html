                    <br>
          <br>"It's important for element IDs to have meaningful names as it allows for easy identification for the programmer to review the code and see which object is doing what and can be easily identified."

                        What is the difference between a programming language and natural (every-day) language?



                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Natural languages are spoken by people, while programming languages are intended for machines.

                        "  Statements in sequential programming are always executed in the correct order, from top to bottom. The software always operates in the same way. Statements in event-driven programming execute in response to input, such as a key press or mouse click."
